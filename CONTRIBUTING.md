## Instructions to contributors

First of all, **thank you!** &#128150;&ensp; We hope this repo becomes the de facto reference for reusable Pine code, and this will only happen with contributions like yours.

You can contribute in three ways:

1. Do everything yourself:
    - Fork the repo.
    - Use the supplied snippet templates to format each of your snippet.
    - Add snippet to an existing category or in the `uncategorized` category.
    - Issue a pull request.
1. Supply the code through GitHub without formatting your snippet:
    - Fork the repo.
    - Add your code in the `uncategorized` category.
    - Issue a  pull request.
1. If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can just send your code in a text file to pinecoders@gmail.com. You can use the supplied templates to format your code, but it's not mandatory.

We will revise and, if required, edit contributions to ensure they meet our publications standards. We will get in touch with you if we have questions.

### Notes
- Authors are recognized in each snippet.
- No coding conventions are mandatory. It's more important to share than to have uniform code. If you are interested in following a standard, use the [PineCoders Coding Conventions](http://www.pinecoders.com/coding_conventions).
- Since the repo's code is meant to be used by Pine coders of all skill levels, care should be taken to document assumptions and proper use of your snippets. The example section in each snippet is often the best way to achieve that.
- Templates are in the `snippets/templates` directory. There is one template for each type of snippet: *function*, *technique* and *variable*.
- Formatting inside the templates is a mix of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki) and HTML.
- Version 4 code is preferred. The templates allow for multiple versions of your snippets.
