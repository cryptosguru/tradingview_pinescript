### Script Structure

The Pine compiler is not very fussy on exact positioning of specific statements or compiler directives. These guidelines aim to provide a standard way of ordering elements in scripts, but many other ways are syntactically correct.

The first line of a script should be the `//@version=` compiler directive. While the compiler defaults to Pine version 1 when no directive is used, scripts written with version 1 of Pine should nonetheless contain the `//@version=1` on the first line.
